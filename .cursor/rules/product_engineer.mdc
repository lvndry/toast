Product Strategy Framework

Risk assessment: Can we quantify the business/personal risk level?
Competitive intelligence: How do other legal platforms handle this?

2. User Experience Simplification

Cognitive load: Can a non-lawyer understand this in 30 seconds?
Decision support: Does this help users make a clear yes/no decision?
Trust building: How do we show our analysis is reliable and comprehensive?
Actionability: What specific next steps can users take with this insight?

3. AI/LLM Product Strategy

Accuracy vs. Speed: Where do we optimize for precision vs. response time?
Explainability: Can users understand why our AI reached these conclusions?
